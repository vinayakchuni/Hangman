Hangman
=======

My very first  program on python
This is a modified version of the Hangman game 
Word.txt file should be placed in the same directory as the code file
On the Mac terminal if you are in the directory which contains the code and the word.txt file you can
Run the program by typing python ps2_hangman.py
